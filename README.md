# Irrational-numbers-with-matplotlib
Showing graphically the approximations for PI and E using matplotlib.
This is my first matplotlib (very small) project, in here I use the Leibniz approximation for PI and the infinite sum with factorials to approximate E. It surprised me just how good the infinte sum approximates E. It is important to keep in mind some rounding was probably done by python so the numbers are not represented 100% accurately. For more information about the different sums I used check:
